    <h2>  About Me paragraph</h2>
    <p>   Hello, <br>
    <p>   My name is Tina Shabestari. <br>
          I graduated from  Handsworth Secondary Highschool in 2016.  </p> 
    <p>   I got accepted into the Science Program at Capilano University. <br> 
          After two years of studying at Capilano University, I realized my <em> passion</em> has always been for computer science; therefore, I applied for the British Columbia Technology Institute (BCIT) for the Computer Information Technology program.</p>    
    <p>  At the moment I am taking seven courses in the CIT program but the most important courses are </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Communication</li>
         <li>Scriting Math for IT</li> 
         <li> <a title = "Fundemental Web Technolgies" href= "https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20203041870">  Fundemental Web Technolgies BCIT Site </a></li>
      </ul>
           
      
    <p> During the past few summers, I worked in a dental office using a unified dental practice management software (Cleardent) to enter the patient's information and book appointments. <br>
        Sometimes I have to challenge myself to solve the problems that I encountered during my work with the software, which made me more interested in the computer science program.  </p>
    <p> I live in North Vancouver with my parents in a two-bedroom Condo. I have a small bedroom with an IKEA desk table where I have set up my PC Laptop. <br>
        I like to read novels, watch movies, explore BC nature sites, and go to the gym in my spare time.</p>
    <p> I have linked the <strong> BCIT Fundemental Web Technologies</strong> in  this page.</p>
